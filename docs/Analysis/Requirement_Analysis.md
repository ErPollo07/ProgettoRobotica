# REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

## Main objective

Simulate an automated production line using robots and save all data related to the production process in a database (ThingsBoard).

## Functional requirements

- Record the movements made by the robots along the production line in the database.  
- Monitor and track the status of the line, including any stoppages or operational anomalies.  
- Provide performance indicators (KPIs) such as:  
  - Number of pieces produced per hour.  
  - Number of pieces produced, broken down by color.  
  - Detection and reporting of errors in case of production stoppage (absence of objects detected beyond a predefined time threshold).
