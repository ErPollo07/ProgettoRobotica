# Robot setup

## Cables

Here are listed all the connections from the robot to other instruments:

- PC: USB-B
- SuctionCup: GP1, SW1
- Laser: GP2
- Conveyor: Stepper1

At the time of work the magic box doesn't need to be used

## Connections problems

If you have installed the dobot link and still the robot doesn't show up in the top-right corner. Or when you click connect it gives some errors, it's very likely to be a problem with the drivers.
To resolve the problem go to device manager and if you see when you connect the usb cable that appears a device under the field "Other devices". You have to install the driver for the device that appears.
